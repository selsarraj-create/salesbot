Child Modeling: "High demand for 'Real Kids'—children with gaps in their teeth, glasses, or unique hair. Big brands like John Lewis and Boden are moving away from 'perfect' child actors toward natural energy."

Mature Modeling: "Massive surge in 'Silver Economy' briefs. Banks (HSBC/Barclays) and Travel brands (Saga/TUI) are specifically looking for 45-70 year olds who look active, approachable, and authentic."

Diversity & Inclusion: "We prioritize representing the real London. Briefs are increasingly calling for diverse backgrounds and inclusive representation across all age groups."
