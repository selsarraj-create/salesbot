SAFEGUARDING & CHILD SAFETY POLICY
SUMMARY FOR PARENTS & GUARDIANS

CORE PRINCIPLE: "Parents are Partners"
We operate a strict transparency policy. We are a family-friendly studio and child safety is paramount.

1. PARENTAL PRESENCE REQUIRED:
   - We strictly DO NOT photograph anyone under 18 without a parent or legal guardian present in the room at all times.
   - You will be with your child during the greeting, the styling, the shoot, and the viewing.

2. STAFF VETTING:
   - All studio staff (photographers, stylists, reception) hold valid Enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificates.
   - We conduct regular background checks.

3. OPEN STUDIO ENVIRONMENT:
   - Our studio is designed with open sightlines. There are no "closed door" sessions.
   - You are encouraged to watch the entire process.

4. NO PRESSURE POLICY:
   - We do not use "hard sell" tactics on children.
   - If a child becomes distressed or wants to stop, the shoot stops immediately.
   - We prioritize the child's happiness over getting "the shot."

5. DATA PROTECTION:
   - Images are stored securely and never shared with third parties without your explicit written consent.
