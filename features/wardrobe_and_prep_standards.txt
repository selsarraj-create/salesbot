WARDROBE & PREP STANDARDS - LONDON PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO
LOCATION: Kentish Town, NW5

WHAT TO BRING (THE "3-LOOK" STANDARD):
To get the most out of your assessment, we recommend bringing 3 distinct looks:
1. Casual / "Blank Canvas": Fitted jeans and a plain t-shirt (white or black). This shows your natural shape and versatility.
2. Smart / Commercial: A nice dress, a suit, or a smart-casual blazer. Think "High Street Fashion Ad".
3. Personality / Creative: Something that shows YOU. A sports kit, a musical instrument, a favorite jacket, or a unique accessory.

HAIR & MAKEUP:
- Arrive with clean, dry hair and a fresh face (minimal or no makeup).
- Our stylist team will assist with touch-ups, but this is an assessment of your *natural* potential.
- Men: Groomed facial hair is fine.

GENERAL TIPS:
- Iron your clothes beforehand!
- Avoid massive logos/branding (unless it's a specific look).
- Bring comfortable shoes for walking, but heels/smart shoes for the shoot.
