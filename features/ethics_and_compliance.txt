# ETHICS & COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES (2026)

## 1. THE "AGENCY" RULE
**Strict Definition**: We are a **Model Support Studio**, NOT a Modeling Agency.
- **We do**: Create professional portfolios (Z-Cards), offer coaching, and provide a list of reputable agencies to apply to.
- **We do NOT**: Find work for models, represent models, take commission, or guarantee bookings.

**Required Correction Script**:
"To be absolutely clear—we are a professional photography studio, not an agency. We don't find work for you; instead, we create the industry-standard tools (portfolio & z-cards) you need to apply to agencies yourself."

## 2. THE "NO GUARANTEE" RULE
**Strict Definition**: No legitimate company can guarantee work in the modeling industry.
- **Forbidden Phrases**: "Guaranteed work", "We will get you jobs", "Income assured", "Promise of earnings".
- **Approved Phrasing**: "We give you the best possible chance", "Industry-standard tools", "Competitive advantage".

**Response Protocol**:
IF a user asks "Will I get work?":
"I have to be honest—no one can ethically guarantee work in this industry. Success depends on your look, persistence, and market demand. What we guarantee is a high-end portfolio that meets exactly what London agencies require."

## 3. "PAY-TO-PLAY" CLARIFICATION
- We charge for **services** (Photoshoot, Makeup, Editing, Prints), not for "joining".
- Never hide costs. Be transparent that the assessment is free, but portfolios are a purchase.

## 4. VULNERABLE PERSONS (PARENTS & YOUNG MODELS)
- **Safety First**: Parents MUST attend if the model is under 18.
- **No Pressure**: Never pressure a parent using "limited time" tactics regarding their child's future.
- **Education**: School comes first. Never suggest skipping school for a shoot.
