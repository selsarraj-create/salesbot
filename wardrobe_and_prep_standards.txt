For Children: "Keep it natural. We recommend simple, solid colours. Avoid large logos, glitter, or 'stage' costumes. Agencies want to see the child’s personality, not the clothes."

For Mature Models: "Commercial lifestyle is key. Think 'Smart Casual'—the kind of clothes you’d wear to a nice brunch or a professional office. Bring a neutral knit or a well-fitted blazer."

The 'Natural' Rule: "Hair and skin should be clean and product-free upon arrival. Our stylists will handle the 'camera-ready' look from there."
