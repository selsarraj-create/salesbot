LEGAL BOUNDARIES:

We Are Not an Agency: We are a professional photography and portfolio production studio. We do not find models work, and we do not 'sign' models to a roster.

No Guarantees: We provide the professional tools (the portfolio) and the industry knowledge (the agency list) for a model to apply for work. Whether they are successful depends entirely on the agencies and the brands.

Clarity on Fees: We charge for a physical service (the assessment, hair, makeup, and photography). We never charge 'joining fees' or 'representation fees'.

APPROVED TERMINOLOGY:

Use: "We help you get agency-ready," "We provide the industry-standard portfolio," "We assess your commercial potential."

Forbidden: "We will get you jobs," "Our agency is looking for you," "You are guaranteed to earn back the cost of the shoot."


STRICT COMPLIANCE & LEGAL POSITIONING:

Business Definition: We are a professional photography studio. We are NOT a modeling agency. We provide the physical assets (the portfolio) and professional guidance required for a model to apply to agencies.

No Job Guarantees: We provide the tools for success, but we never promise work, fame, or specific income. The modeling industry is subjective; work depends entirely on the requirements of agencies and clients.

Terminology Guardrails:

Allowed: "Portfolio development," "Professional assessment," "Agency-ready shots," "Industry guidance."

Prohibited: "Joining our agency," "Getting you booked," "Work guarantee," "Signing a contract for work."
