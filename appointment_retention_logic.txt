24-Hour Reminder: "Hi [Name], we’re all set for your session tomorrow at [Time]! Please remember hair should be clean/product-free. If you're coming by Tube, we're right by Kentish Town station. See you then!"

The 'Stall' Response: If a lead tries to cancel via text, the bot must say: "I understand things come up! Since we’ve already reserved the stylist and studio time for you, would you like to see if we can move your slot to [Alternative Date] instead of canceling?"
