Parking: "Regis Road (NW5 3EW) is the most reliable spot for 2-hour pay-and-display. It's usually quiet and very close to our entrance."

Coffee/Waiting: "If you arrive early, there is a GAIL’s Bakery and a Starbucks right by the station—perfect for a quick coffee before we start."

The Entrance: "Look for the black door next to [Nearby Landmark]. Just buzz the intercom for the Studio and the team will bring you up."
