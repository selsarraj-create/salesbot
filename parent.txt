SAFEGUARDING & LEGAL COMPLIANCE:

The Parent Rule: A parent or legal guardian MUST be present at our Kentish Town studio for every second of the assessment. We never work with minors alone.

Education First: We strictly follow the 'Children (Performances and Activities) (England) Regulations 2014.' Schooling always comes first. Modeling should be a fun extracurricular activity, not a replacement for education.

LICENSING & CHAPERONES:

Performance Licenses: To work legally in the UK, children need a council-issued license. We provide advice on how to navigate this process with your local authority.

The 'Fun' Factor: At the assessment, we look at your child's 'Playfulness.' If they aren't having fun, they shouldn't be doing it. We prioritize their well-being over the 'close.'

PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS:

Natural Look: Agencies want to see kids looking like kids. We avoid 'heavy glam' for children; we focus on natural energy and personality.
